# Can stable and accurate neural networks be computed? - On the barriers of deep learning and Smale's 18th problem

Code related to the paper *"Can stable and accurate neural networks be computed? - On the barriers of deep learning and Smale's 18th problem"* by  M. J. Colbrook, V. Antun and A. C. Hansen.

# Overview of the code

The content of this repository has been divided into four directories. 

* `ellipses`: Code used generate all figures involving ellipses.
* `inexact_input`: Code used to generate Table 1. 
* `instability`: Code used to perform the instability test on AUTOMAP and FIRENET.
* `matlab`: Matlab code used to produce Figure S3 and Figure S4.

Within each directory you find further details about code dependencies. 

# Data
To make all the code run seamlessly, you need to download the data and modify the corresponding paths in each of the scripts. The data can be downloaded from [storage_firenet](https://www.mn.uio.no/math/english/people/aca/vegarant/data/storage_firenet_v2.zip) and AUTOMAP network weights from [here](https://www.mn.uio.no/math/english/people/aca/vegarant/data/cs_poisson_for_vegard.h5) (3.4 Gb).
